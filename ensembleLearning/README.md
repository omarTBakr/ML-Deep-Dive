📑 this is my summary for ensemble learning and random forest.
✌ I tried to follow a tutorial style so anyone can follow through + also I added some mathematical flavours here and there 
🎯 learning objectives 
✅ know what we mean by ensemble?
✅ know voting classifiers and how they work?
✅ what are bagging and pasting and how do they work?
✅ get into decision Trees and random forest 
✅ get into boosting and know 
 ☑ ada boosting 
 ☑ gradient boosting
 ☑ XJBoost
✅ what is stacking and how it is implemented?
